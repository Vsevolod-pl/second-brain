Cooperative game with TU is a pair $(N, v)$, where
- $N$ is a set of players
    - $S \subseteq N$ â€” is a coalition
    - $S = N$ is a grand coalition
    - $2^N$ is a set of all coalitions
- $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $v(\emptyset) = 0$, is the coalition function
    - $v(S)$ is the worth of a coalition $S$
