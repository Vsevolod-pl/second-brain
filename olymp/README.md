# How to Improve
### Solve contests
Solve as many contests relevant to your level as possible
- https://codeforces.com/contests
- https://atcoder.jp/contests/
- If there are no official contests available, use virtual participation, which is accessible on both websites
### Upsolve problems
Usually it's a good practice, to try and solve the problem by yourself, however much time it takes. And iff everyone else has solved the problem fast, but you're struggling, then read the editorial.
